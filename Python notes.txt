Expression = values + operators

Recap:
 - IDLE is an editor
 - Interactive Shell (>>>) & File Editor
 - Expressions = Values + Operators
 - int, Float, String
 - 'Hello World'
 - Spam = 42
 - Spam + 1

"The Execution"=which instruction is being currently executed

Functions are mini-program in your proogram

values passed to functions = Arguments  

Recap:
 - Type programs into the file editor
 - The execution starts at the top and moves down 
 - #Comments are ignored by python
 - Functions are mini-programs in your program
 - print() lets user type in a value
 - len() takes a string value and returns an integer value 
   of the string's length
 - int(), str(), and float() convert values' data type

Recap:
- Boolean Data Type: True, False 
- Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- == is comparison, = is assignment 
- Boolean Operaors: and, or, not

Recap:
- An if statement can be used to conditionnally execute code, depending
  on whether or not an if statement's condition is True or False.
- An elif (that is, "else is") statement can follow an if statement.
  Its block executes if its condition is True and all previous conditions
  have been False.
- An else statement comes at the end. Its block is executed if all the 
  previous conditions have been False.
- The values 0, 0.0, and rhe empty string are considered to be Falsey 
  Values. When used in conditions they are considered False. You can
  always see for yourself which values are Truthy or Falsey by passing
  them to the bool() functiion.

 - #Comments are ignored by python
 - Functions are mini-programs in your program
 - print() lets user type in a value
 - len() takes a string value and returns an integer value 
   of the string's length
 - int(), str(), and float() convert values' data type

Recap:
- When the execution reaches the end of the a while statement's block,
  it jumps back to the start to re-check the condition.
- Press Ctrl-C to interrupt an infinite loop.
- A break statement causes the execution to immediately leave the loop,
  without re-checking the condition.
- A continue statement causes the execution to immediately jump back to
  the start of the loop and re-check the condition.

Recap:
- for loops will loop a specific number of times.
- The range() function called with one, two, or three arguments.
- break and continue can be used in for loops.

FUNCTIONS 
+++++++++
Recap:
- You can import modules and get access to new functions.
- The module that comes with the Python are called the standard library,
  but you can also install third-party modules using the pip tool.
- The sys.exit() function will immediately quit your program.
- The pyperclip third-party module has copy() and paste() functions for reading
  and writing text to the clipboard.
